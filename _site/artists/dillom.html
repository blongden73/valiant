<p>After going viral in YouTube after collaborating with Bizarrap in 2019, Dillom became one of Latin America’s biggest urban artists. In 2020 he released his first studio album “POST MORTEM”. This album is the work of his life narrated in self-referential songs, with bars that go to the bone without taking many turns. For some of them, he had the collaboration of artists and colleagues such as LGante, Muerejoven and Saramalacara, and the participation of Mario Pergolini in one of the interludes.</p>
