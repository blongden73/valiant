Their sound is an exotic cocktail of contemporary disco and futuristic electro-boogie, with a production style resting somewhere between Peggy Gou and The Rah Band, and vocal performances reminiscent of Easter, Saâda Bonaire, and Janet Jackson. Ultraflex brings us a bundle of joy, selfirony and snarky attitude wrapped up in danceable beats. After winning the award for best Icelandic electronic album of 2020 collaborating with Okay Kaya, a new album will be coming out in Autumn 2022.</p>
