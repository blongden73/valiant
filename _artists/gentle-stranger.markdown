Gentle Stranger’s Tom Hardwick-Allan, Alex McKenzie and Josh Barfoot follow debut ‘Love And Unlearn’ with ‘Phantom Thoroughfare’ an album inspired by a myriad of curiosities including William Blake, a letter from Grandma and being eaten alive by a Falcon. Across the fourteen tracks multiinstrumentalists Gentle Stranger peer through their looking glass at the likes of nature.
