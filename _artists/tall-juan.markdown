On Raccoon Nights, musician and producer Tall Juan returns with his most resplendent creation yet. Down the hole we dive into a world of psychedelic-pop enveloped in buzzy synthesizers, burning backbeats, and new wave overtones. Throughout these nine songs, Juan grapples with isolation and uncertainty, bringing along an impressive troupe of collaborators to share in the healing party.

Recorded at Outlier Inn in New Yorkâ€™s Catskill Mountains and at his home in Rockaway Beach, Juan aimed for a high-fidelity sound that reflected the difficult times he was living through. Taking on the roles of both engineer and producer, he wanted to work with as many musicians as possible, which resulted in contributions from over 30 different players. When tracking was finished, the album was mixed by Grammy award winner Hector Castillo, whose glittering resume includes projects with David Bowie and Phillip Glass. This synergetic process culminated in an uplifting sound inspired by artists like Syd Barrett, Talking Heads, and Lizzy Mercier Descloux.
