Tall Juan is about 6 feet and 3 inches and though his career he has developed the art of pastiche. He has managed to escape labels and put out songs that only an Elvis Latino inspired by The Ramones could have delivered. In the past years he released “Why Not?”(2015) recorded and mixed by his fellow housemate Mac Demarco in their Rockaway beach house, “Joya Nedo” (2017) and his LP “Olden Goldies” (2017.In 2020 he released “Atlántico” a compact exploration of the sounds that form the cultural fabric of Zaballa’s youth. “Drawing on the music of his youth, Buenos Aires-born songwriter Juan Zaballa’s second album cleverly illuminates Latin America’s rich musical heritage”- PITCHFORK
