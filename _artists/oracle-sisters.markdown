Last year saw Oracle Sisters included in NMEs Essential Artists list and The Line Of Best Fit described their music as “moody soundscapes that evoke an exotic, dream-like state rife with tension and sexual danger.« Everything is now in place for Oracle Sisters to take their place as one of the brightest acts to emerge from the Parisian music scene, with an upcoming double EP release and signing to exciting New York label 22TWENTY. 

Touring Europe with Papooz and Polo&Pan allowed them to cut their teeth in the live arena and build fans in mainland Europe, and over the past year they’ve started to build a sizeable audience in the UK, with sold out shows in London and Edinburgh. 

“Cryptic lyrics and mesmerising harmonies combine with jangly guitar for a dreamy introduction to Parisian duo's two-parter release”-NME
