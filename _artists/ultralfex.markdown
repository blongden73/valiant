Ultraflex is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Farao (NO) and Special-K (IS). Their saucy debut album ‘Visions of Ultraflex’ was released in 2020 to critical and popular acclaim, winning The Icelandic Music Awards 2020 and Kraumur Award. 

Ultraflex’s sound is inspired by disco and synth-funk, a blend between nostalgic 80’s and cutting edge PC Music-type sounds – mixed with new-agy tones, unexpected jazz chords and melodic twists. The band gathers material from “high” and “low” art, pushes it through a pop-culture filter and creates their own brand new lotion carefully tailored to your needs.
