Madge is an ageless wizard making weird chaotic pop music. The LA-based musician grew up in the small town of Provo, Utah, where she was raised Mormon and trained as a classical musician. Madge returned to songwriting while earning her degree in performance studies at NYU and reckoning with her religious beliefs. Madge’s lo-fi DIY pop, in all it’s raw, ADHD-infused glory, revolves around Madge as the main character at the center of a self-created universe.
