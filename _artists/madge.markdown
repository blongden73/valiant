Madge is the pop writer breaking hearts and noses from their cat cave in Los Angeles. Originally from Utah, their Mormon upbringing continues to influence them for better or worse.  Madge has worked behind the scenes for the likes of Pussy Riot, Brooke Candy, and Slayyyter among others and is looking forward to releasing their debut album this year. BBC Radio1 has described Madge as “like chewing on toxic waste in the best way”.
