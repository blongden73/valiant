Hailing from Madrid artist and performer Virgen Maria (Maria Forqué) is here to ‘blex’ you. A thin line between art and music is drawn every time Virgen Maria manifests her blexing powers, a cocktail of sex, hotness, sweat and spirituality. Meanwhile her aesthetic and conceptual art has already led to collaborations with the likes of Fenty, Gucci, Mugler, Playboy, Vetements and Camper, as well as performing live at both the MOMA and Sonar.
