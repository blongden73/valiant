La Élite is a group that was born in Tàrrega during the year 2015 as a result of boredom and the
need to spend time in a more or less “productive” way. So, during that same summer Nil and
Diosito locked themselves in the garage for 4 afternoons and made their first demos, from which
songs like Marlburro came out.
The band will continue for a few years making demos for pure fun and without any kind of claim
beyond making music with synthesizers and drum machines. Until 2020 there is not much to
add, they just do their own thing.
It is not until the end of the pandemic that they release music again and decide, after 7 years,
to play live. Since then, the band has not stopped growing based on single releases, later their
debut album, and with a very electric live show, irreverent, and cheeky, filling up virtually all of
their concerts and festivals on a grand tour for Spain.
In November 2023 they plan to release the new singles to what will be their second lp, which is
planned for Feb/March 24 release.
