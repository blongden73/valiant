Melbourne four - piece Jade Imagine fuses together elements of synthwave and art-rock, with a signature style of bleak pop and contemplative new-wave. After signing to Courtney Barnett’s Milk! Records for their debut EP in 2017 and supporting Julia Jacklin on tour last year, the band have signed to London-based record label Marathon Artists and released “Basic Love” in 2019. ‘You Remind Me Of Something I Lost’ follows the release of the band’s 2019 debut album ‘Basic Love’.
