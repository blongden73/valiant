A key collaborator with Archy Marshall, Ignacio was one of the forces behind King Krule's Mercury Prize nominated The Ooz and named as one of the central influences for Man Alive and Space Heavy, King Krule's most recent records. Pitchfork has coined Gal Go's music as "a burst of passion that's mysterious and striking". Gal Go returns with a batch of exhilarating new music in 2024.
