Rebe is a lost doll that, when squeezed, produces whispers, cries and chords that a thousand times have sounded in the tradition of Spanish song, this time crossed by interferences that seem to sneak in from a nearby fair or a distant forest. It was created, according to her, after love and just before passion. That may explain why it has ballads of incomparable eroticism. However, the intricacies of its sounds and its way of piling up arrangements on the outline of a pop song to the point of deforming it make it difficult to place it in any genre. Rebe tells little legends about herself, theatrical love entanglements that are sweet, bitter, ridiculous, fiery and catastrophic, but never implausible because she is the protagonist. Actually, as a doll she is deceptive, for it is she who plays with you once she has your attention. It seems that she is only looking at herself in the mirror, but she is at the same time captivating, making you uncomfortable, begging and making fun of whoever looks at her.
