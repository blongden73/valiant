Lucky Bamba is a London based, multi-instrumentalist and producer.

From the likes of some of Londonâ€™s new wave most important characters such as Bruno Major, Tom Misch and Holly Humberstone, his sound alternates between Jazz, R&B and Pop. Soft and shimmery guitar arrangements create a uniquely soulful and smooth sound. His voice and his 335 guitars are his best allies when it comes to portraying his life and adventures as a multicultural songwriter.
