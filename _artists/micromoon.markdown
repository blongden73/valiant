Micromoon started in late 2019 by Ben Spence, Dan Alvarez-Giraldo and Rei Mancero-Rodriguez.
The band sits in a unique place culturally alternating equally from psychedelic rock influences with
hip-hop, hardcore and outstanding lyrics, which often reflect the band’s own experiences and those of their peers growing up in East London.

2021 saw Micro moon follow up their early releases, Falling and I-IV, with a run of 6 singles, Raining, Cracked, Different, Sugar, Light and Pain. The Run of 21 saw them pick up some radio attention, play a leading spot at Fuzzbrain and Lamesfest’s Hoodstock as well as tour with Chubby and The Gang.
