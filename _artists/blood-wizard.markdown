Straddling a divide between spacious rural folk and urban post-punk claustrophobia, Blood Wizardâ€™s debut album, released in 2020, was a prelude to what is shaping up to be a true blossoming of the song writing abilities of Nottingham-based musician Cai Burns. After performing touring the UK and performing at Green Man and End of the Road Festival, 2022 will be time a new EP and more dates around the UK & Europe.
