Blood Wizard is the moniker of Cai Burns, a singer songwriter hailing from South London by way of Nottingham. He burst into the scene with his debut album ‘Western Spaghetti’ in 2021, released to a frenzy of underground acclaim through the revered indie label Moshi Moshi Records. Offering a twisted interpretation of the earthy tones and introspective musings of artists like Aldous Harding and Kurt Vile, Blood Wizard carved his own unique path. Performances at End of the Road’s main stage, Pitchfork Festival and an endorsement from Wet Leg followed, as did sold out headline shows in London and further afield.

Now, with his sophomore effort ‘Grinning William’, Blood wizard unveils a more intricate and diverse body of work. Without compromising his distinctive sound, this second album ventures into sonic realms akin to the captivating discographies of artists like Alex G. Produced by Theo Verney (of Lime Garden, English Teacher, and Egyptian Blue), the 2024 offering signifies a monumental leap forward for the former Kagoule frontman. Exceptional songwriting and a kaleidoscope of moods are united by Blood Wizard’s wry vocals and poetic lyrics that have become his signature. Stepping beyond the enigmatic allure of his debut, ‘Grinning William’ sees Blood Wizard emerge once more from the woody undergrowth with a 10-tracker of even greater originality: another seminal record for those in the know.
