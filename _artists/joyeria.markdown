In the latest instalment of Speedy Wunderground’s iconic singles series, Canadian London-based artist Joyeria presents himself to the world on the rattling epic “Here Comes Trouble”. While the Canadian artist presents himself as an elusive figure, the track is far from evasive in its approach, with a no-holds-barred directness. Emanating from a place of lamenting struggles with vices, our narrator describes how the temptations of drinking and gambling lead to “trouble closing in”.
