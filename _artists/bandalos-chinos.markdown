Bandalos Chinos are a sample of the new Latin Indie generation. Originally from Beccar (Buenos Aires), Bandalos fuses rock, pop, funk and electro into a new eclectic proposal with two Latin Grammy nominations so far. 2022 will be the year they release their third studio album and their first European tour which will take them to Primavera Sound.
