After touring Europe with Ca7riel, Paco Amoroso released his debut solo album SAETA in 2021. In 10 songs, he distances himself from trap and enters the tradition of Argentine pop .The album includes collaborations with his idol Adrián Dárgelos (“Switch”), Tío La Bomba (“Chinga Sport”), El Doctor (“Cerebro”) and Lara 91k (“Aire”). Despite its fragmented genesis in the hands of eight producers (Tadefonk, Alot, Percii, Maxi Sayes, Bruno Donato, Neekl and Polsick), SAETA manages to be a homogeneous piece. In 25 minutes, it tells the story "of a young man who is still learning to take his steps", in the words of Paco.
