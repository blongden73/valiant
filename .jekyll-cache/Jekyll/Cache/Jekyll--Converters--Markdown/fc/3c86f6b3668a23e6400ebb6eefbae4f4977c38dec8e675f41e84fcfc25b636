I"ù<p>Imagine an African artist with the tenderly subversive touch of Bon Iver, the haunting falsetto of Skip James, the razor-like mind of Akala, and the inventiveness of later period Radiohead. Its focus is specific, but its themes â€“ the bondage of neo-colonialism, the need for heroes, the relevance of history and the search for true identity â€“ are universal. After collaborating with Disclosure and doing his own COLORS session, Blick is now in the process of recording his fourth studio album.</p>
