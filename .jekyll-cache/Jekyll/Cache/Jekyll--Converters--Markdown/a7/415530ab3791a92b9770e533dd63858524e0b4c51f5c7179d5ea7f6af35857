I"H<p>Talia is exciting, experimental and punk as hell. From behind her signature balaclava and ruff, her curls sticking out of the top like a crown, she raps in a gravelly voice. New singles are coming soon, and an album’s on the horizon, too. With a successful run of art projects under her belt – the latest a trippy short film for Charles Jeffrey’s Loverboy – Talia has found herself in an underground art scene of creatives. It’s mostly lo-fi jazz and hip-hop artists; a scene in which spiritualism, LGBTQ rights and racial justice are a real focus for the community.</p>
