I"‹<p>After touring Europe with Ca7riel, Paco Amoroso released his debut solo album SAETA in 2021. In 10 songs, he distances himself from trap and enters the tradition of Argentine pop .The album includes collaborations with his idol AdriÃ¡n DÃ¡rgelos (â€œSwitchâ€), TÃ­o La Bomba (â€œChinga Sportâ€), El Doctor (â€œCerebroâ€) and Lara 91k (â€œAireâ€). Despite its fragmented genesis in the hands of eight producers (Tadefonk, Alot, Percii, Maxi Sayes, Bruno Donato, Neekl and Polsick), SAETA manages to be a homogeneous piece. In 25 minutes, it tells the story â€œof a young man who is still learning to take his stepsâ€, in the words of Paco.</p>
