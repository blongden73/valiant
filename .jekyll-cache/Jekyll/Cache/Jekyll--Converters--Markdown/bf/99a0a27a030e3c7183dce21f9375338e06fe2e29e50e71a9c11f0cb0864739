I"ã<p>Melbourne four - piece Jade Imagine fuses together elements of synthwave and art-rock, with a signature style of bleak pop and contemplative new-wave. After signing to Courtney Barnettâ€™s Milk! Records for their debut EP in 2017 and supporting Julia Jacklin on tour last year, the band have signed to London-based record label Marathon Artists and released â€œBasic Loveâ€ in 2019. â€˜You Remind Me Of Something I Lostâ€™ follows the release of the bandâ€™s 2019 debut album â€˜Basic Loveâ€™. Prior to that, Jade Imagine had supported Stella Donnelly on her Australian national tour and Pond in the UK. â€œâ€˜Basic Loveâ€™ is an intimate soundscape, pivoting between unanticipated euphoria and robotic inquisition.
