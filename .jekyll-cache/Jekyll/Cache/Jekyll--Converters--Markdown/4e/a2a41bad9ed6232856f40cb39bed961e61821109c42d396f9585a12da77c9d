I"€<p>Ultraflex is an interdisciplinary collaboration between Farao (NO) and Special-K (IS). Their saucy debut album â€˜Visions of Ultraflexâ€™ was released in 2020 to critical and popular acclaim, winning The Icelandic Music Awards 2020 and Kraumur Award.</p>

<p>Ultraflexâ€™s sound is inspired by disco and synth-funk, a blend between nostalgic 80â€™s and cutting edge PC Music-type sounds â€“ mixed with new-agy tones, unexpected jazz chords and melodic twists. The band gathers material from â€œhighâ€ and â€œlowâ€ art, pushes it through a pop-culture filter and creates their own brand new lotion carefully tailored to your needs.</p>
