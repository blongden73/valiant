What is a rebel? A person who says no, but whose refusal does not imply a renunciation. A person who says yes as soon as it think's for itself.

In every act of rebellion the concerned individual experiences not only a feeling of revulsion at the infringements of it's rights but also a complete and spontaneous loyalty to aspects of the self.
